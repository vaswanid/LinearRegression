# LinearRegression

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. It’s used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog). There are two main types:

Simple regression

Simple linear regression uses traditional slope-intercept form, where m
 and b
 are the variables our algorithm will try to “learn” to produce the most accurate predictions. x
 represents our input data and y
 represents our prediction.

y=mx+b
